To change two vertically split windows to horizonally split

Ctrl-w t Ctrl-w K

Horizontally to vertically:

Ctrl-w t Ctrl-w H

Explanations:

Ctrl-w t makes the first (topleft) window current Ctrl-w K moves the current window to full-width at the very top Ctrl-w H moves the current window to full-height at far left

Note that the t is lowercase, and the K and H are uppercase.

Also, with only two windows, it seems like you can drop the Ctrl-w t part because if you're already in one of only two windows, what's the point of making it current?
